# Loan Default prediction
The dataset comes from Lending Club which is a peer-to-peer lending platform. Loans amounts are between $1000 - $40,000. The projects uses data from 2007 - 2011 and each loan is labels as either Fully Paid or Charged off. 

:sparkle:The aim is to build a classification model that will predict whether a particulary borrower is trustworthy. The dataset is supplemented with FICO status chart that explains the scorings.

:sparkle: Below are the questions that are supposed to be answered:

- :white_check_mark: What is the correlation between FICO scores and default probability
- :white_check_mark: Does the credit experience impact default likelihood and is the risk somehow related to FICO scores?
- :white_check_mark: What is the impact of borrower's mortgage status?
- :white_check_mark: Does the annual income have any impact?
- :white_check_mark: What is the importance of employment history?
- :white_check_mark: How does the loan amount impact the default likelihood?

Finally, using AUROC score, the model is trained and evaluated.
